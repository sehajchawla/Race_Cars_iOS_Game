# Race Cars (iOS Game)
This is my first game to be released on the App Store, it has simple premise, get as far as you can in a race again traffic!


The controls are simple: tap on the side of the screen with the car that you want to switch lanes. Switch lanes to avoid crashin into traffic.

Tha game is made smart, with an ingame currency that you can use to buy more cars which have unique advantages (like slowing down time, getting headstarts, and switching lanes faster).
